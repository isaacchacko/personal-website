		<p class="blurbs">I've proficient in industry standards like Python and C++, and am also capable in more niche languages like Clojure and ClojureScript. I'm able to pick up concepts on the fly, and like to find the similarities between disiplines to learn them more easily. Here is a screenshot of my code to visualize differential equations, known as a flow field.</p>
